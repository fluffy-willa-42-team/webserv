### `execve`

`execve` is a system call used to execute a new program. It replaces the current process image with a new one, specified by its file path and command-line arguments. It also allows you to provide a custom environment for the new program.

### `dup`

`dup` is a function that duplicates a file descriptor. It creates a new file descriptor that refers to the same file or socket as the original descriptor. This is useful for redirecting input and output streams, as well as for managing multiple file descriptors that refer to the same resource.

### `dup2`

`dup2` is similar to `dup` but allows you to specify a specific file descriptor number for the duplicate. It can be used to close a file descriptor and replace it with a new one, ensuring that the new descriptor has the desired number.

### `pipe`

`pipe` creates a unidirectional communication channel (pipe) that can be used for interprocess communication. It returns two file descriptors: one for writing to the pipe and another for reading from it. Pipes are often used to establish communication between parent and child processes.

### `strerror`

`strerror` is a function that takes an error code as input and returns a human-readable string describing the error. It is commonly used to convert error codes into meaningful error messages for debugging and logging purposes.

### `gai_strerror`

`gai_strerror` is a function specifically used for handling errors related to the `getaddrinfo` function, which resolves hostnames and service names into socket addresses. It converts error codes from `getaddrinfo` into human-readable error messages.

### `errno`

`errno` is an external integer variable that is set by system calls and library functions to indicate the type of error that occurred during their execution. Programmers can examine the value of `errno` to diagnose and handle errors.

### `fork`

`fork` is a system call that creates a new process by duplicating the existing process. The new process is a copy of the original and continues to execute from the point where `fork` was called. This is often used for parallel execution of code.

### `htons`, `htonl`, `ntohs`, `ntohl`

These functions are used for converting between the host byte order (the byte order used by the processor) and network byte order (a standardized byte order used in networking protocols). `htons` and `htonl` convert host-to-network, while `ntohs` and `ntohl` convert network-to-host.

### `select`

`select` is a system call that monitors multiple file descriptors for readiness to perform I/O operations without blocking. It is often used in network programming to manage multiple sockets and wait for events such as incoming data.

### `poll`

`poll` is a system call that provides a more efficient alternative to `select` for monitoring multiple file descriptors. It allows you to specify a list of file descriptors and wait for events on any of them.

### `epoll` (`epoll_create`, `epoll_ctl`, `epoll_wait`)

The `epoll` family of functions is used for efficient event notification in Linux. `epoll_create` creates an epoll instance, `epoll_ctl` controls the events to be monitored for a specific file descriptor, and `epoll_wait` waits for events to occur on one or more file descriptors. This is commonly used for high-performance I/O operations.

### `kqueue` (`kqueue`, `kevent`)

`kqueue` is a mechanism for event notification on BSD-based systems. `kqueue` creates a kernel event queue, and `kevent` allows you to register and monitor various types of events on file descriptors. This is often used for efficient I/O multiplexing.

### `socket`

`socket` is a function that creates a socket endpoint for communication. Sockets are used for network communication and can be configured for different communication domains, types, and protocols.

### `accept`

`accept` is used in server programs to accept incoming connections on a listening socket. It creates a new socket for communication with the client and returns the file descriptor of the new socket.

### `listen`

`listen` is used to configure a socket for listening to incoming connections. It specifies the maximum number of pending connections that can be queued for acceptance.

### `send`, `recv`

`send` is used to send data over a socket, and `recv` is used to receive data from a socket. They are fundamental functions for network communication.

### `bind`

`bind` is used to associate a socket with a specific local address and port number. It is often used in server programs to specify the address on which the server should listen for incoming connections.

### `connect`

`connect` is used to establish a connection to a remote server or endpoint. It is typically used in client programs to connect to a server.

### `getaddrinfo`, `freeaddrinfo`

`getaddrinfo` is used to resolve hostnames and service names into socket addresses. It can be configured with hints to control the type of address to resolve. `freeaddrinfo` is used to release memory allocated by `getaddrinfo`.

### `setsockopt`

`setsockopt` is used to set various options on a socket, such as setting socket-level options, controlling behavior, and configuring socket options.

### `getsockname`

`getsockname` is used to retrieve the local address and port number to which a socket is bound. It is often used after `bind` to confirm the actual binding information.

### `getprotobyname`

`getprotobyname` is used to retrieve protocol information by name. Given a protocol name (e.g., "tcp" or "udp"), it returns a `struct protoent` containing information about the protocol.

### `fcntl`

`fcntl` is a general-purpose function for performing various file control operations. It can be used to manipulate file descriptors in various ways, such as setting them to non-blocking mode or obtaining flags associated with a file descriptor.

### `close`

`close` is used to close a file descriptor. It releases the associated resources and allows the file descriptor to be reused.

### `read`, `write`

`read` and `write` are used for reading data from and writing data to file descriptors, respectively. They are fundamental functions for working with files, sockets, and other I/O devices.

### `waitpid`

`waitpid` is used to wait for a specific child process to terminate. It allows a parent process to monitor the status of its child processes and collect exit status information.

### `kill`

`kill` is used to send a signal to a process. Signals are a way to communicate with and control processes, and `kill` is often used to request that a process terminates or to send other signals for specific actions.

### `signal`

`signal` is used to set a function to handle a specific signal. Signals are a way to notify processes of various events or to request specific actions. `signal` associates a signal with a custom signal handler function.

### `access`

`access` is used to check whether a file or directory can be accessed with the specified permissions. It tests the accessibility of a file based on the specified mode, such as read, write, or execute permissions.

### `stat`

`stat` is used to retrieve file status information, including details like file size, permissions, and timestamps. It provides valuable information about a file or directory.

### `opendir`, `readdir`, `closedir`

These functions are used for working with directories. `opendir` opens a directory for reading, `readdir` reads the next entry in the directory, and `closedir` closes the directory after processing its contents.
